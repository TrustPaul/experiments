Sport 
Over the years, sporting organisations and volunteers have formed the backbone of sport in Ireland. Building on this legacy enriches the lives of active participants and as well a country which values vibrant, local community identity and the achievements of our sporting heroes.
Sport and recreation also have other benefits for the nation, both economic in terms of sports tourism, employment opportunities through growth in the sector, and social in terms of better physical and mental health and wellbeing.
The period of Covid-19 restrictions resulted in significant fluctuations in physical activity. However, participation in sport continued to rise in 2022 and recover from the impact of Covid-19.",What is the role of sporting organisations and volunteers in Ireland?,"The sporting organisations and volunteers have formed the backbone of sport in Ireland, enriching the lives of active participants and contributing to the country's vibrant, local community identity.

This project proposes a technology that can be placed on the pipeline to constantly monitor the composition of the fluid within.

This will highlight to homeowners/primary tenants the key issues to consider when renting a room to a student and similarly to students what to expect when accepting an offer of accommodation.
Voluntary Licence Agreement 
As the Rent-a-Room scheme falls outside the Residential Tenancy Act, a standard tenancy agreement does not apply. It is therefore recommended that a written licence agreement is established between the homeowner/primary tenant and the student in advance of taking up the offer of accommodation. A licence agreement means that a person is in the property with the homeowners’ consent or invitation. The Licensor (the homeowner or primary tenant) is the person who grants the licence (occupancy rights of the property) to the Licencee (e.g. the student).",Who is the Licensor in the licence agreement?,The Licensor in the licence agreement is the homeowner or primary tenant who grants the licence (occupancy rights of the property).,https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/be552-rent-a-room-voluntary-regulatory-framework/

Introduction
When you buy a used car from a trader (a car dealer, garage or a business selling on an online marketplace), you have similar consumer rights as when buying a new car.
You can expect the car to meet certain conditions of quality and durability and match what was set out in the contract. While you can’t expect a used car to be the same standard as a new one, the quality should reflect the price you paid. If you buy at an auction you don’t have the same rights if the car is 'sold as seen'. Check the auction's conditions of sale before you buy.
If you buy from a private seller, you also have fewer legal rights. This is because consumer law applies to contracts between a trader and a consumer and does not cover consumer-to-consumer deals.",What legal rights do you have when buying from a private seller?,"When buying from a private seller, you have fewer legal rights compared to buying from a trader.
