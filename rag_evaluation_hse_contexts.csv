It is usually available throughout the year\nfrom your GP.\nIf you have recently received a Mpox vaccine (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/monkeypox/vaccine/), wait 4 weeks before you\nget the COVID-19 vaccine. This is a precaution because of the unknown risk of myocarditis. Myocarditis is an inflammatory heart\ncondition.\nCOVID-19 infection during pregnancy\nMost pregnant women who get the virus get mild to moderate symptoms. They give birth as planned and the risk of passing on\nCOVID-19 to their baby is low.\nBut you are more likely to get very unwell and need treatment in intensive care than a woman who is not pregnant. The virus may\nalso cause complications for your baby (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/people-at-higher-risk/covid19-and-pregnancy/).\nVaccination protects you and your baby\nBeing vaccinated will reduce the chance of you becoming very unwell from COVID-19 and reduce the chance of complications for\nyour baby.\nCOVID-19 vaccines are not shown to have any negative effect on babies in the womb. They may help protect your baby after birth\nas you may pass on antibodies from the vaccine to your baby.\nChildren under the age of 1 are at higher risk of hospitalisation and severe illness from COVID-19. Young babies whose mothers\nwere vaccinated in pregnancy were less likely to need hospital care with COVID-19.\nGetting a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy gives you, and your baby, the best possible protection from COVID-19\nRead more about COVID-19 and pregnancy (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/people-at-higher-risk/covid19-and-\npregnancy/)\nEvidence shows COVID-19 vaccines are safe\nPregnant women in Ireland have been safely getting the COVID-19 vaccine since May 2021. There has been no increase in\nreported side effects from COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women or their babies anywhere in the world.\nBut COVID-19 vaccines are new. We are still learning about them. There is limited data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in\npregnancy. They were not tested on pregnant women during clinical trials.\nThe COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines. This means they cannot give you or your baby COVID-19. The vaccine doses are\nrapidly broken down in your body. They cannot become part of your or your baby’s DNA.\nIf you decide not to get vaccinated\nYou may decide to wait until your baby is born or until you have more information before getting a vaccine.\nIf you wait, there is a greater risk you will become very unwell if you get COVID-19. There are also risks for your baby.\nTake extra care to protect yourself against COVID-19 (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/preventing-the-spread/protect-\nyourself-and-others/) if you decide not to get vaccinated.\nAvoid situations where you could pick up the virus. This includes crowded areas.\nIf you are trying for a baby\nYou do not need to leave any gap between having your COVID-19 vaccine and:\ntrying to get pregnant\nhaving fertility treatment (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/fertility/fertility-treatment/), such as IVF\nFertility and COVID-19 vaccination\nThere is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination affects fertility. Do not put off having a vaccine because you are hoping to get\npregnant.\nIf you are breastfeeding\nYou can get a COVID-19 vaccine if you are breastfeeding. This will protect you from getting seriously unwell due to COVID-19.\nYou can continue to breastfeed safely after being vaccinated.']"

Watch and tune into your baby’s facial expressions, eye and body movements.\nAsk yourself what your baby is thinking, feeling or showing interest in.\nRespond to your baby by:\ntalking to them about what they are interested in - for example, “You’re looking at the light”\ngoing slowly at their pace - they need time to process new experiences and words\ngetting face to face, making eye contact and smiling – find a comfortable distance (approximately arm’s length) that allows\nyour baby to focus on your face\nlistening to your baby and leaving little pauses for them to take their turn - this shows them that you are interested in their\nthoughts and feelings\ncopying their sounds and actions and waiting to see how your baby responds - if they say ""bababa"", repeat it back to them\ncomforting them when they cry - this helps set a strong foundation for their communication development, make your baby\nto feel safe and secure and build healthy self-esteem\nYour baby\'s mental health (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/parenting-advice/baby-and-child-mental-wellbeing/help-your-\nchild-manage-feelings/)\nYour child\'s social, emotional and behavioural development (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/social-\nemotional-behavioural/)\nSpeaking your native language\nTalk to your baby in your native language. In two-parent families, this could mean your baby is exposed to two or more languages\nfrom birth. For example, if one parent speaks with baby in their native Polish and the other parent talk to them in their native English.\nThis is best for their speech and language development.\nActivities to try\nYou can also do fun activities with your baby to help them develop speech and languages, such singing nursery rhymes.\nSongs and nursery rhymes\nSing songs and nursery rhymes with your baby. It\'s a fun way to repeat words and use actions with words.\nWatch a video on using repetition to help your child\'s communication (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?\nv=DgVPPngyWDY&list=PLsQK32cdMW_ygwiXLtpIu11owvqX8HctB&index=5)\nPicture books\nSnuggle up and share a picture book together. Allow your baby to hold the book. Notice what your baby is interested in and talk\nabout that for example, “You see the monkey!”\nAt this stage, this is more important than reading the words in the book.\nPlay on the floor\nYour baby can learn so much language through playing with you. At this stage, your baby might enjoy touching or holding little toys\nwith different feels, like soft blocks or a rattle.\nPace your play to suit your baby. You can repeat lots of new words, for example “shake shake” or “the ball feels squishy!”\nPeek-a-boo']"
