73750," Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits . ",0

4856, What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up . ,1
4872,How annoying ! ,1

6408, She ’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can ’ t you be good to her ? ,1
6410,You ’ re making my blood boil . ,1
6412, I'm about to explode ! You ’ Ve made a mess of this matter . ,1
6414, Sorry isn ’ t good enough ! What can you do to help me ? ,1

15811, They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! ,1
15813," I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again ! ",1
15815, They both just talk about how great they are all the time . ,1
15816, They soud like the neighbours from hell ! ,1
15817," They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . ",1
16398," Really , Mary , you ’ re horrible . ",1
16399," Why don ’ t you marry Rose , then ? ",1
16568, We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! ! ,1
16571," You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know . ",1
16572,It's taking you forever to do my hair . ,1
16574, You should've been done already . ,1
16576, I don't think that you're done . ,1
16578, My hair looks hideous . ,1
16580, It doesn't look good at all . ,1
16582, I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this . ,1
16584,Excuse me ! I don't have time to waste . I've been here almost one full hour ! ,1
16588," Oh , gosh ! I have to go to the restroom so bad ! I can't bear it anymore ! ",1
16591,What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! ,1
16593, I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! ,1
16703,Look at what you have done . All thumbs . ,1
17158, Waiter ! ,1
17162," I've never been to such a dirty restaurant , and never seen such slow service . ",1
17173,"Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! ",1
17375, What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! ,1
17920, my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . I can't wait for the weekend ! ,1
17922, you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work ! ,1
18538, Didn ’ t I tell you ? It ’ s over ! ,1
18540," It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! ",1
18542," No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home ! ",1
18544," I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . ",1
18545, I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude ! ,1
18546, I know . I still haven ’ t heard from her . The good thing is that I ’ m so angry with her that I don ’ t feel sad about not having her around . ,1
18720," You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! ",1
18888, Just get out of my face ! ,1
18890, Leave me alone ! ,1
19084,What a terrible house ! ,1
19086," The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! ",1
19482,I know I ’ m going to bite the dust going down this hill . I almost got killed on the chair lift ! This is going to be so embarrassing . ,1
19488, No ! ! ! ,1
19772, Easy ? Ha ! ! It was easy for them to cheat you ! ! ,1
19775, I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! ,1
19777, Why not ? ,1
20094," The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . ",1
20096, I'll beat him . ,1
20893,I ’ m itching for moving ! ,1
20895," It ’ s so wet and dark , I ’ m just fed up . ",1
21163,"This is the end , Jane . I don't want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time . ",1
21165, No way . I've given you too many chances already . ,1
21735, Don't brother me ! ,1
21836, How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . ,1
22241, You can ’ t take me to jail ! What about my sleigh ? It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help ! ,1
22561, Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! ,1
22563, You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? ,1
22594, I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . ,1
22596, You should feel shameful for your behavior . ,1
22950, Didn't I tell you ? It's over ! ,1
22952," It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! ",1
22954," No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home ! ",1
22956," I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone . ",1
22958, I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around . ,1
23381, What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . ,1
23673, Crazy is too kind . Insane is more like it . Nuts ! Wacko ! Psycho ! ,1
23897,What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . ,1
24039, what a bummer ! You set me up ? ,1
24041, how dare you ! ,1
24152,They promised us a sea view . ,1
24154, Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . ,1
24769,It's terrible how things have changed.You remember there used to be trees on all these hills . ,1
25059," No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for Drin ",1
25061," I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . ",1
25063, Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves . ,1
25313," Shut up . You should think how to make fortunes , not look for a squabble . ",1
25594," No , I just check my weight , I'm getting fatter . ",1
26181,You're spending a very long time on my hair . ,1
26185, Are you sure you're finished ? ,1
26187, You did a horrible job on my hair . ,1
26204,"Emily , what kind of report is this ? ",1
26206," Don't get smart with me . Here , do it again , but do it right this time . ",1
26282," This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! ",1
26373,Look what you've done ! ,1
26375," Yes , and hurry up ! ",1
26381," Yes , and please be more careful in the future ! ",1
26386,"I really don't know how to break this to you , but it ’ s eating me alive ! ",1
26501," But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late . ",1
26503," But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ? ",1
26505, But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ? ,1
26676," No , you must stay ! I swear it , and the oath shall be kept . ",1
26677, I tell you I must go ! ,1
26680, I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion . ,1
26681, I'll never again come to your side ; I am turn away now and can't return . ,1
28111, Quiet everybody ! ,1
28177,My son has really taken it out of me . He never keeps out of mischief . ,1
28179, Yeah . Anyway he is driving me mad . ,1
28443," Come on , Liz . Be open-minded ! Look at my eyes , they are puffy . And my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles . I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings . ",1
28522, I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! ,1
28683,You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now ? ,1
28685, You are always like this . I've told you many times not to tell her . ,1
28687," It's too late to say sorry now.Oh , what am I going to do ? ",1
28695, That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? ,1
28941,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! ",1
28943, It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! ,1
29126,Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long ,1
29128," Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . ",1
29243," What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me ! ",1
29245, I can ’ t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ’ t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car ! ,1
29317," I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! ",1
29319," That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! ",1
29513, That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . ,1
29515, And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? ,1
29568, addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! ,1
29727," Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! ",1
29729, I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . ,1
29731," 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! ",1
29756, I won't be paying you for this . ,1
29759," You don ’ t love me , Roy . ",1
29761," No , you used to be . But not now . You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting . ",1
29763, I envy her and also I hate her at the same time . ,1
29765," Oh , shut up , Roy . ",1
29767," Oh , SHUT UP ! ",1
29828,Joan is a thorough drag ! ,1
30039," Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! ",1
30080, But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . ,1
30082, I don't care . ,1
30094,I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . ,1
30096, What did you think you were doing ? ,1
30098, How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . ,1
30252,You didn't tell me she was married ! ,1
30254, I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me ! ,1
30415," The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . ",1
30780,Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! ,1
30781," I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! ",1
31341," Just get out of my face , would you ? ",1
31345, Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ? ,1
31347, Get out of here ! ,1
31349," Oh , gag me ! She's totally gross ! ",1
31453,I hate to see the abuse of animals . ,1
31454, It makes me sick . ,1
31561, You ! ,1
31563, You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ? ,1
31569, Don't bother . ,1
31636, My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! ,1
31797," Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . ",1
31834,I have a bone to pick with you . ,1
31836, You always have a chip on your shoulder . ,1
32112,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer.It ' s unbelievable ! ,1
32114, He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . ,1
32116," I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . ",1
32437, We ’ re in the same boat ! I ’ Ve eaten fast food the whole week . I hate it now . ,1
32529,How could you have done that without asking me first ? ,1
32766,It smells like an ashtray in here ! ,1
32768, What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . ,1
32770," Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . ",1
32772, Fine ! I want a divorce ! ,1
32943, Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . ,1
32947," Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . ",1
33505,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? ,1
33507, But you should have told me you were in love with her . ,1
33509, You know you didn't . ,1
33511," Yes , but you might have told me before . ",1
33513, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? ,1
33515," Oh , you men ! You're all the same . ",1
33585, Absolutely not ! I'm not a thief . ,1
34349,Did you hear what she said to me ? ,1
34351, What do you think I should do about it ? ,1
34441,"I'm really fed up with Larry ! He's the biggest airhead I've ever met.He always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with . ",1
34443, You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is . ,1
34477," Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! ",1
34537,I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone . ,1
34579,I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . ,1
34581, What did you think you were doing ? ,1
34583, How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . ,1
34605," I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! ",1
34606," He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! ",1
34619, Just get out of my face ! ,1
34621, Leave me alone ! ,1
34872,Congratulations on the new house ! ,1
34873, Thanks ! We love it . ,1
34874," Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful . ",1
35100," I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ? ",1
35101, And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot . ,1
35215,"Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . ",1
35217," I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . ",1
35432, But how guilty to waste food ! ,1
35513, Why ? It's in mint condition ! ,1
35517, I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me ! ,1
35734, Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise . ,1
35869,Do you have any idea what time it is ? ,1
35877," If you do this again , don't even bother coming home . ",1
35880," Well , if I'm not living here anymore , then I won't have to listen to your rules . ",1
35901, You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study . ,1
35903, Who knows ! That might come to later . ,1
36143, I can't stand riding the bus . ,1
36144," Me too , it's so unreliable . ",1
36146, It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather . ,1
36147, Exactly.That ' s the worst part . ,1
36237,The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break ! ,1
36430," Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! ",1
36549,"Mom , I hate eating vegetables ! ",1
36553, But I don ’ t like them.It ’ s not fair . ,1
37318, You can ’ t take me to jail ! What about my sleigh ? It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help ! ,1
37345," Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ? ",1
37366,"What a mess , Jack ! ",1
37548," I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . ",1
37837, You said you were only going to window shop ! ,1
37838," I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! ",1
37981, You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? ,1
37983, I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! ,1
37985," I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! ",1
38030," Oh , this one is perfect . ",1
38220,"Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . ",1
38884, It's none of your business . ,1
38886, I'm going out anyway . Get out of my way . ,1
38973," Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! ",1
38977," He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! ",1
38979, I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! ,1
39010," Look , traffic jam again ! ",1
39281,Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . ,1
39691," This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . ",1
39699, So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . ,1
39892, I was late for work because of them . ,1
39894, I want my money back for the delivery . ,1
40035, Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy ! ,1
40052, it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own . ,1
40364, I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches ! ,1
40442," yes , they were horrible . We had to wear green every day ! ",1
40493," At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ? ",1
40495," But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ? ",1
40497," But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ? ",1
40584," Oh , come on ! Don't be so sour . These are beautiful shirts . I know if we don't buy some today , you will never go shopping by yourself . ",1
40606, Are you crazy ? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake ? ,1
40608, Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have ? ,1
40722, Come on mom . I'm your A ! Wait till the guys hear about this ! ,1
40957,Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head ! ,1
40965," That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking . ",1
40966," I don't need your help , jerk . ",1
41064,"Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . ",1
41075,"May , look at this mess ! You threw waste everywhere . ",1
41235, I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right . ,1
41237," I wish he could understand . You know what , if this goes on , I think I will get stick like everybody else . ",1
41295, Good heavens ! Don't bring that frog in the house . ,1
42917, Yes . I can't find my sweater . I have my laundry sent to you yesterday but when the washing is done . I find my swatter missing . ,1
43307, Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here ! ,1
43309, Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . ,1
43310, Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! ,1
43311," When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful ! ",1
43417, You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . ,1
43418," Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! ",1
43619,this bloody computer ! ,1
43621, my computer just crashed again for the third time today ! ,1
43625," oh , no ! I thought it seemed a bit strange . ",1
43654,"Oh , the food here really is bad . My soup was cold and meat , ur ... it was like leather . ",1
43655, Yes . And they don ’ t give you very much either . I ’ m still hungry . ,1
43656, I ’ m sure this one is especially bad . And the word is so unpleasant . ,1
43657, Don ’ t do this ! Don ’ t do that ! You mustn ’ t do this ! You can ’ t do that ! ,1
43658," Well , I ’ m going to write a letter of complaint . ",1
43659, And we ’ ll all help you . ,1
43719,"This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . ",1
43731, They arrested me for nothing . ,1
43733, They weren ’ t supposed to arrest me . ,1
43735, They didn ’ t let me go until the next morning . ,1
43737, They sure did . ,1
43741, I want to take them to court . ,1
44180,Shut up ... Billy ... BILLY ! ,1
44519, I've had enough . ,1
45135,I have a complaint to make . I've just been badly treated by a rude maid . ,1
45512,"I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking . ",1
45514, It ’ s simply because the tins were damaged . ,1
45516," I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling . ",1
45626," First I was late for school this morning , and now I broke your vase . This isn't my day ! ",1
45878," Which leg do you want to have , right leg or left one ? ",1
46533,I was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my counter-offer . ,1
47732," But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . ",1
47734," Make it work , Geoff . You would say that , wouldn ’ t you , he is your cousin.what a jerk , make me hire your stupid , useless , cousin . ",1
47767, I want to take them to court for arresting me . ,1
47769, There was no reason for them to arrest me . ,1
47771, They released me the next morning . ,1
47773, That ’ s exactly what they did . ,1
47777, I ’ m definitely taking them to court . ,1
47959, It's unfair . ,1
48114, Mom ! ! ! Please . All my friends have had it for years . ,1
48289, I got the message . I'm quiting . ,1
48291," I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time.If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . ",1
48293," Very well , consider me gone . ",1
48574, I don't care . I have a headache . ,1
48752,"Listen , Christine , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . ",1
48762, I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you ! ,1
48817," Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . ",1
49408,Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mike ! ,1
49409," If I hear "" Love Me Tender "" one more time , I think I'm going to go crazy ! ",1
49678,We are through . ,1
49680," Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day . ",1
49682," But I ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home . ",1
49684, You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone . ,1
49686, I don't buy a story . ,1
49688," No , don't , I don't want to see you anymore . Don't ever call me again . ",1
49732, Are you kidding me ? ,1
49733," You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ? ",1
49734," We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together . ",1
49735, I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before . Any more rules that you would like to tell me about ? ,1
49736," Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well ! ",1
49737, I am really looking forward to getting away from you . Far away from you ! ,1
49804," No , we got no receipt , but we paid on the spot . ",1
49913, I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . ,1
49963, No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ? ,1
49965, You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? ! ,1
49997,I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven ’ t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need ! ,1
50219, You don't know what you are asking ! ,1
50252,What a terrible house ! ,1
50254," The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking ",1
50255," There's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! ",1
50256," It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it ! ",1
50316,What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! ,1
50318, I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! ,1
50521, What ! I resent that ! ,1
51006,I don't understand why I'm being arrested . ,1
51008, A warrant for what ? ,1
51010, What does that mean ? ,1
51012, I wasn't aware that I had to go to court . ,1
51014, I don't find this fair . ,1
51016, Don't I have any rights ? ,1
51289, Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? ,1
51290," What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . ",1
51671," Get out of my store , you jerk ! ",1
52293, It certainly didn't arrive here that way . ,1
52323,Hello ! We ’ Ve been waiting for our lunch order for over an hour . Did you forget our order ? ,1
52394," I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! ",1
52408,I can't stand being with you any more . I'm sick of your drinking . ,1
52410," How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you . ",1
52412, It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility . ,1
52414, Even if I was seriously ill you couldn't spare a moment . ,1
52416, I just don't trust you any more . ,1
52612, That's true . You can hear my tummy grumbling . I am really hungry ! ,1
53169," Let me go to school , please ! I'm sick of medicine , sick of soup , and sick of being sick ! ",1
53394, But nobody uses Macintosh ! ,1
53492, Do you think I believe the story like that ? ,1
53494, How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? ,1
53665, Don't you dare tell me that ... ,1
53667," Well , they should have called you ! ",1
53669, And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ? ,1
53671, It's the holidays ! Everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets ! ,1
53673, Trust you ! You can't even handle simple plane reservations ! ,1
53749, I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful ! ,1
53751," Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty ! ",1
53828," Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ’ s all junk food ! ",1
53988, But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night ! ,1
54114," Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! ",1
54120, That ’ s so unfair ! ,1
54145, Silly boy ! The dustbin is at the back of the school . Now pick up the paperand put it in the dustbiri . ,1
54257,I'm going crazy . ,1
55188," Whatever . Just turn right here . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . let ’ s take a side street . Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move ! ",1
55189, What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! ,1
55441, Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ? ,1
55443, I wasn't done talking to you . ,1
55444," I have to do some things , and besides , it's not polite to be nosey . ",1
55446, I really don't think it's any of your business . ,1
55447, That's not nice . ,1
55520, You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement ! ,1
55537, Don ’ t tell me what to do ! I ’ ll get to it when I get around to it ! ,1
55667," Shut up ! Now you are in my car , you should listen to me . Or you can get off . I've told you I'm in a hurry . I don't want to waste time on the road . ",1
56098, Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages . ,1
56283, It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . ,1
56287, It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . ,1
56438," Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! ",1
56440," It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . ",1
56442," That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! ",1
56871," Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable . ",1
57158,I have to talk to you ! ,1
57160," I know , Blake . But you ’ Ve been avoiding me all morning , and we have got to talk about this deal with the Mc Kinsey Food Company . ",1
57274,Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? ,1
57276," Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . ",1
57277," Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . ",1
57388, What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation ? ,1
57389," You and I have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us ! ",1
57390, Really ? Who made that rule up ? ,1
57391," With that attitude , I don't really think we have much more to discuss here . ",1
57392, That works for me ! ,1
57705," If you want to cross here , be my guest . I don't feel like dodging cars and scooters ! ",1
58052, What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! ,1
58113," You ’ re questioning my ability ? I tell ya , I can make it ! I ’ ll talk to your boss . ",1
58115, You think so ? Let ’ s take a chance ! ,1
58158,"Ann , it's terrible ! ",1
58163, I think it's because of your bad habits ! ,1
58385,I know why Mr . Fro didn't like our ad idea ! He doesn't know the first thing about coffee . ,1
58615, Why don ’ t you help me save money ? You are always spending money . ,1
58874," Yes , I joined your group of bus tour this morning . You promised the journey will last 3 hours and we will visit 15 sightseeing spots . ",1
58876, But have 2 - hour journey . ,1
59002," Oh , no ! ",1
59182," I can wait , but my toothache can't ! ",1
59304,I'll be late because I have waited so long ! ,1
59489, I ’ d like to know why you ’ re always taking credit for work we ’ Ve done together like that line in the new Ice Cream ad ? ,1
59490," That was my line , Mark . I know we worked on the ad together , but that was definitely my line . ",1
60264, Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room . ,1
60846," Look for it yourself , please ! Kinda busy here , Daniel ! ",1
61061,"I want to change rooms . In fact , I want a refund for tonight ! ",1
61063, Cockroaches have declared war on my room ! ,1
61166,Look at the traffic . It ’ s terrible ! ,1
61707,I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered . ,1
61709, That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night . ,1
61715, Absolutely unbelievable ! You people should be ashamed of yourselves . ,1
61768,Do you know how late it is ? ,1
61772, Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late ? ,1
61776," Come home late one more time , and you'll find your stuff outside . ",1
61779," That's fine , because if I leave , then your rules won't matter . ",1
61910,Ah ! No ! Damn it ! ,1
61914," No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . ",1
61922," Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . ",1
61932, Damn ! ,1
62018, You said the same thing three months ago . ,1
62034," This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! ",1
62117," Darn ! Oh , well . I guess it ’ s just not my day . Thanks anyway . ",1
62205, I said sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you . ,1
62570, That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! ,1
62571, Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . ,1
62572, I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . ,1
62609, What did I do ? I haven't done anything . ,1
62613, I didn't do anything . ,1
62615," No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . ",1
62617," I don't need your help , jerk . ",1
62655, His face broke out and he said it was my fault ! ,1
62753,Why aren ’ t they are aware of the gravity of the situation ? ,1
62784,The washing machine isn't working again . ,1
63101, Dammit ! I asked for sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you . ,1
63125," Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault . If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . ",1
63126," Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . ",1
63372,Oh . I just wanted you to shut up . You were off-key anyway . Let me see that ! ,1
63630,Could you please stop flipping the channels ? ,1
63646,"Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus . ",1
63938,I'm very annoyed at your disobedience . ,1
64026, You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday . ,1
64030," Oh , don't you ? God save me ! ",1
64103, I dislike my roommate . He really turns me off . ,1
64167, See you . ,1
64412,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It's unbelievable . ,1
64414, He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . ,1
64416," I've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me . ",1
64825, Curse this oven ! Curse it ! ,1
64827, Curse the worst oven in the world . ,1
64981, I haven't even told you what it is yet ! ,1
64985," Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! ",1
64991, That ’ s so unfair ! ,1
65543, Forget it ! It was a bitter pill for me to swallow . ,1
65554, I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches ! ,1
65627, What ? You're overcharging me ! ,1
65634, Try to be more careful in future . Look ! You ’ Ve damaged the sign . ,1
65660, Stop picking on me . I am going to be mad . ,1
65740, My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! ,1
65744, Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor . ,1
66085,Ouch ! I'm hurt . ,1
66463, that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ? ,1
66651, Get out of it ! It wasn't as good as you think . ,1
66750,I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . ,1
66752," yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty . ",1
66754, but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? ,1
66840," Well , I hate to disturb you , but I really can't stand it any more . Can you change my room for me ? It's too noisy . I was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . It was too much for me . ",1
66894, You ’ re a liar ! ,1
67021, Why ? You can't be always so lazy . ,1
67143, I want to file a complaint . ,1
67145, A man robbed me today . ,1
67426, How dare you question my statement ! ,1
67834,"Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ... ",1
67836," I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ... ",1
67838," Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just give me my money ! ",1
67840," No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No ! ",1
68034," All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better ! ",1
68036, Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy ! ,1
68217, Mom ! That is so unfair ! ,1
68220, I don ’ t want to hear it ! Now go to your room ! ,1
68259,"Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! ",1
68267,Why am I being arrested ? ,1
68269, I don't have a warrant . ,1
68271, I don't know what a bench warrant is . ,1
68273, I was never told to go to court . ,1
68275, This isn't fair . ,1
68277, What about my rights ? ,1
68591, I told you to hurry up a thousand times . You just put a deaf ear to it . ,1
68595, It's all your fault ! Now we can't get in shopping . ,1
68892,Why are you arresting me ? ,1
68894, What kind of warrant ? ,1
68896, What is that ? ,1
68898, I never went to court . ,1
68900, This is unfair . ,1
68902," I have rights , don't I ? ",1
69392,My stomach's growling again ! ,1
69489, They arrested me without probable cause . ,1
69491, They had no reason for arresting me . ,1
69499, I want justice . ,1
69896, How depressed ! ,1
70075, Just look ! In six short weeks I've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle . ,1
70326, Why are you so bitter ? No one tells worse joke than you . ,1
70575,Why am I being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered ? ,1
70581, You can't do that ! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made ! ,1
70583," Well , now I've seen it all ! What a rip-off this place is ! ",1
70750," But what ? You always act like this , when you face difficulties . ",1
70775,"Oh , my goodness . The traffic is crawling . ",1
70917, You can ’ t just throw me out on the street ! ,1
71163," Well , there's nothing I can do about my height ! ",1
71207,Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! ,1
71312, Who's your manager ? Tell me ! Would you ? ,1
71574," Oh , how annoying ! ",1
71576, Is's infuriating ! I have to be in Rome by five . ,1
72222, That's not fair ! ,1
72540, We have to wait six more minutes ! ,1
73025, You said the same thing three months ago . ,1
73027, You mean I won't get a raise until recession ends ? ,1
73029, I got the message . I am quitting . ,1
73169, It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . ,1
73173, It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . ,1
73412,Excuse me . Who is the person responsible for handling complaints here ? I would like to make a few complaints . ,1
73414," Here is the thing . I was woke up by strange noises of the telephone several times last night . Even I unplugged it , it wouldn't stop beeping . I am also not satisfied with the housekeeping service in my room . So I want to change to a cleaner and quieter room . ",1
73549,What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one . ,1
73996," Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired ! ",1
73998," Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things . ",1
74147,"My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie , but I never ordered one . ",1
74149, That's absolutely wrong ! I was out exploring the city Monday night . ,1
74153, Are you serious ? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched ? ,1
74155, This is outrageous ! I'm never coming back to this hotel again ! ,1
74250, I don't get it . I'll go and have that doorman talk to you then . ,1
75143,Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mic ! ,1
75144," If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy ! ",1
75145, He sounds like a sick cow ! ,1
75167, At least I enjoy my lunch ! What's in your bag ? ,1
75169," There's the difference , your wife made it ! I have to make my own lunch ! ",1
75220,"Gordon , you're ever so late . ",1
75222," But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . ",1
75224, How on earth can you miss several buses ? ,1
75226," Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? ",1
75232, I am not convinced by your explanation . ,1
75420," Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . ",1
75429, Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . ,1
75433, To hell with you . The accident was your fault . ,1
75435, To hell with you . ,1
75457," Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over . ",1
75616," Well , I'm really surprised . You are not doing anything behind my back , are you ? ",1
75914," Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! ",1
76125," Yes , I think I did . It has to be one of your maids who took it . I want my necklace back . ",1
76127, That just isn't good enough . Cet me your general manager . I want to speak to him now . ,1
76533, Come on ! What have you got to lose ? ,1
76798, It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! ,1
76802, Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . ,1
77278," Peter , it's a quarter to twelve . Let's go home now ! ",1
77520, I can ’ t possibly travel on a hard seat for 10 hours ! ,1
77702, It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . ,1
77743," Oh , how annoying ! ",1
77745, What a nuisance ! ,1
77815," No , we got no receipt , and we pay it on the spot ! ",1
77964,"John , I ’ Ve asked you not to smoke in here ! I don ’ t want to see you smoking in my office again . ",1
77966," That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside ! ",1
78020," No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh . ",1
78022, So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it . ,1
78024," No , thank you . ",1

78393, I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak . ,1
78737," You've just scratched my car . Oh , God , a paint was scratched off . ",1

79824, I was robbed . ,1
80082," I just told you , Debbie . I tried to call you twenty times ! ",1
80960," Oh , my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball . ",1
80970," Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . ",1
80972," Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . ",1
81237,I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . ,1

81250," Well , you should be sorry ! Don ’ t ever use my computer again ! You can ’ t do anything now , it ’ s too late ! ",1
81336, That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! ,1
81337, Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . ,1
81338, I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . ,1
81414, There are nine cockroaches in my room . I don't have time for your disbelief ! ,1
81451, I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! ,1
81452," This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! ",1
81577, Damn it ! I think I'm going to miss the plane . ,1
81810," Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! ",1
81812," It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . ",1
81814," That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! ",1
82419, That's sheer robbery ! ,1

84133,"And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . ",1
84135," Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . ",1
84137," I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am ! ",1

85409," Oh , yes . I get six Korean channels but nothing in English ! ",1
85757," What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ absurd ! ",1
85759," Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . ",1
85761, That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! ,1
85888," Yes , you should have . ",1
85892, Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . ,1
85893, Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! ,1

86742,"Shit , so crowded ! ",1
86745, We have too many cars ! ,1
419,"Oh , no ! ",2

1215, Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . ,2
1437, Yes . It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world . People say it will break out again om Valentines ' Day this year . ,2
1438, This is terrible . Why do hackers play such a dirty trick ? ,2

1774,I'm really sick of waiting for a bus . ,2
1953,"Lousy weather , isn't it ? ",2
1959, It feels like ten degrees below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery . ,2
2316," Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ’ t go together . ",2

3682,I really dislike reading academic books . ,2
3892,Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . ,2
3896," I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? ",2
4030," Oh , Goodness , please not again.That ' s what we did last week . ",2
4251,I dislike Susan . She is always above herself . ,2

6028,"Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . ",2
6030," Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . ",2

8134, I wish I hadn't chosen this job . ,2
8292,My husband goes out drinking with his friends every night . I'm fed up with it . ,2
8537," Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within . ",2

26727," If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison . ",2

26729," I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ’ s still a millionaire . ",2
26730, That ’ s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . ,2

30162, That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . ,2
30163," What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? ",2
30177, That ’ s stupid . ,2
30451, Sorry to trouble you . But I don't think this fish is fresh . It actually tastes a bit off . ,2

31087,Many people say it's a good story.But I think it's boring ! ,2
31750,I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment . ,2
31752," He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . ",2
31754," You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . ",2
31854," I get along pretty well with most of them.It seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch , though , Like Margaret . I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet.She ' s a terrible gossip . ",2
32048,I've had enough of that ! ,2
32050, I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel . ,2
32434, Well I don ’ t think so . I don ’ t like it at all ! ,2
32703, The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat . ,2
32931,That woman is a thorough drag ! ,2
32933, She keeps spitting on the ground . ,2
33036,What a boring film ! ,2
33037, The acting of the heroine is too artificial . ,2
33038, And the plot is so simple . ,2
33171, Not really . I thought it was disappointing . ,2
33173, Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . ,2
33892," All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! ",2
33930," Well , I hate to have to say this , but I'm not happy with my room . ",2
34588," Yes , it's my steak . ",2
34590," It's too raw . I wanted mine well done , but this one here is almost medium . ",2
34999,"I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted . ",2
35001," You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . ",2
35177, Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . ,2
35281," Hey , watch where you ’ re going ! ",2
35470," Oh , great . That's just my luck ! I hate those arty movies . ",2
38971," To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! ",2
38975," There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure . ",2
39628, Hong Kong again . I would like to go somewhere different for a change . ,2
40037," We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard ! ",2
40206," Today , I am busy all day long . ",2
40720, Any body piercing ? Stick out your tongue ! ,2
40785," He's awful ! He telephoned me four times yesterday , and three times the day before yesterday . He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon . My boss answered the telephone . ",2
40787," He said , Pauline is typing letters . She can't speak to you now ! "" Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening . He telephoned again . But I didn ’ t answer the phone ! ",2
40791," I said , This is Pauline's mother . Please don ’ t telephone my daughter again ! ",2
43414,Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? ,2
43416, It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . ,2
44431," Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . ",2
44433," That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning . ",2
47999," No , cats are too dirty . They are lazy and cunning . I don ’ t like them at all . ",2
48001," You can keep the cat , but you should keep it away from me . ",2
48792,You shouldn't let the dirty dishes accumulate in the sink ! ,2
49410, He sounds like a sick cow ! ,2
50822," Granted , it ’ s cheap , but the place is filthy , the beds are uncomfortable , there ’ s no A / C , the breakfast is pretty skimpy ... and the staff couldn ’ t care less about the guests . ",2
50824," Just one night , when my flight was canceled due to bad weather . It ’ s bearable if you just need a place to crash , but you definitely don ’ t want to book a vacation there . Unless you enjoy sharing your room with cockroaches . ",2
52129,You stink ! ,2
52581, Ohhhh . I hate this part of my job . ,2
53325,"No , it hasn't . It's very dirty . ",2
53333, You are lazy . You ought to be ashamed ? You should enjoy working . ,2
53510," That would be very good of you , Mr . White . ",2
53678, Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes . ,2
54359," I'm sorry , but I can't ! That's something my grandmother would sing ! ",2
55875, Not very long from the looks of it ! ,2
55878, Gross ! ,2
55880, But I think Eddy is going too far ! ,2
55946," Wow , your apartment is a mess . ",2
56418,"Egg , this bathroom is a pigsty ! ",2
56420," I just can't stand it . It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . So I cleaned it ! ",2
56422, I can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here ! ,2
57831, It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! ,2
57833," On top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting . ",2
58971," I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . ",2
58973," Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . ",2
61483,"Honey , the house is such a mess ! I need you to help me tidy up a bit . My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless ! ",2
62020, You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ? ,2
62160," I know you , Zina . You're only nice when you want something . ",2
62485, Good idea . I'd suggest you do some crunches too . Thery're great for getting in shape . Make sure you do them correctly . ,2
63530, I've been fed up with study . ,2
63532," Oh , my . Why there are still so many things to learn after graduation ? ",2
65830,This is awful ! It's like drinking saltwater ! It's like drowning in the ocean ! ,2
67800," I'm sorry , I'm very tired . I'm going to bed early . I didn't have good time , and I don't really want to see you again . ",2
67802, It was hardly all night . And I recall it was you doing all the laughing at your own jokes . ,2
67804," No , I ' m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I ' m too tired now . I have to go to sleep . Goodbye . ",2
68228, Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps ! ,2

71388," Oh , My God ! So much ! ",2
72718,I ’ m so frustrated ! ,2
72726," Eventually I did get to a real person . I found out the closing time , but by then the store had already closed ! ",2
72836," Yes , and the food was horrible ! ",2
73891, He is a dishonest man and always tells a cock and bull story . ,2
75618, Haha ... You are not very funny . I guess that means - - except me to tell my lover we have stoped seeing each other too . ,2
75619, You are not funny either . I can't believe I married a woman like you . ,2
75740,My God ! Why did you bring me here ? I hate the taste of coffee . ,2
78820,The kitchen stinks . ,2
81795, ... What a stink . This place stinks like rotten eggs . ,2
83935, Bull . I're done my research . I know you still control more than 65 percent of invoking options . ,2

1114,"Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! ",3
1116, I think someone is stalking me . ,3
1126," Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? ",3
1128, Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! ,3
2057, I'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty P . m . ,3

5306,"Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! ",3
5308," I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! ",3
5543," School . Since I was working part time , I had a difficult time keeping up with class . Now that we have exams coming up , I'm totally freaking out . ",3

35952, Thank you very much . ,3
37305, i think i'll be a little afraid . ,3
37307, afraid of making a mistake . ,3
37552, But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? ,3
37554," Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . ",3

22140," Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me . ",5
22142, She said it was because we had very different ideas about life . ,5
22144, Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly . ,5
22157," I'll have us ready for Stars.com by the end of next week . After that , I don't know . ",5
22284,I wish the teacher wouldn't make us read this book . ,5

24813, It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . ,5
25126," Hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things . ",5

25136, Shall we keep pur friendship ? ,5
25152," Well , my mum lost her job yesterday . ",5
25154, The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole . ,5
25160, I just lost my job . I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills . ,5
25162," I just started , but the job market is very bad right now . I'm not optimistic about it . ",5

27169, My father failed in business . ,5
27171, Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . ,5

30099, I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . ,5
30600, Rather . I'm afraid I didn't do very well . ,5
30635,Our son is gone and my heart is gone too . I don ’ t know how to spend the rest of my years . ,5
30637, I feel life is meaningless without him . ,5
30815, I'm sorry . ,5
30853,"Well , it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies . Maybe we're just different kinds of people . ",5
30854, Yeah it's too bad ... but actually I think I know what to do . ,5
30914," Oh dear , that sounds terrible . ",5
30915, It was ! But the worst thing was I tore my best shirt . ,5
31083," Yeah , I know , but it's too hard to do . ",5
31085," Only sometimes when I think about it , I feel very sad . ",5
31361," well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . ",5
31363," now that I look back at it , it wawsn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . ",5
31367," I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? ",5
31369," well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . ",5
31507, But I still love you . ,5
31509, I knew this would happen some day ... ,5
31511," Well . It's not all my fault , Anna ... ",5
31513, Have you made the decision yet ? ,5

31527," Sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night . ",5
31530," Sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going . ",5
31566, I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up . ,5
31610, I really don't want to know about this . Physics gives me a headache . ,5
31673, My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . ,5

32794,"I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester . ",5
32800, I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . ,5
32806, I already had that idea . ,5
32812, I have to find something.Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months . ,5

33795,"I'm sorry , I'm having a little trouble understanding your accent . ",5
33829," it was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day . ",5
33833," I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough . ",5
34144," I have already known that . I didn't get the scholarship , right ? ",5
34146, Can you help me ? You know I do need the scholarship . ,5
34251,I'm afraid I can't complete my paper on time . ,5

35876, That's true . My bad for not calling . ,5
35919," Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . ",5
35980," Really , because spicy food is my favorite . ",5
35998, I'm sorry . I think we're out of this skirt in this color . Do you want me to call another one of our store to see if it's available there ? ,5
36189," Not bad.Li Hong , I am sorry that I can ’ t go to see Mrs.Brown with you tomorrow morning.My mother is ill . I must take care of her . ",5
36190," I ’ m sorry to hear that.You ’ d better stay at home.After all , we can visit Mrs.Brown later ",5
36574, I'm sorry . ,5
36631,"Darling , can't you stay for a few more days ? ",5

37114, No . ,5
37116, I got robbed ! ,5
37118, Some guy on the street just mugged me . ,5
37120," No , he just stole all of my things . ",5
37180, I should've just stayed on the bus . ,5
37181, I messed up . ,5
37506, it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another . ,5
37508, I ’ m fine . But I have bad news . ,5
37510, I got sacked today . ,5
37562," I'm sorry , sir.The price is fixed . ",5
37880, I ’ Ve got some bad news . All the plans sent over to the McGrath Corporation have been rejected . We ’ re going to have to start from scratch . ,5
37881, I thought they had already agreed to everything . That ’ s going to take weeks to rework . ,5
37888," I am sorry , sir , it's for 4 persons to have . I think it's too large for you . ",5
37890," Sorry , sir . We have never done that before . ",5

38294, How am I going to face the fellows in our office ? They thought I would be promoted . They must be waiting for my good news . ,5
38296, But I lost the chance . ,5
38370, I'm sorry . The restaurant is full now . You have to wait for about half an hour . Would you care to have a drink at the lounge until a table is available ? ,5
38429," I'm sorry , that's bad luck . ",5
38544," It's just too bad . I have to leave it as it is , and thank you just the same . ",5
38600, This is a pity ! ,5

38787," I apologize , and I'll make sure he doesn't do that again . ",5
38957," Sorry , sir . That table has been reserved . This way , please . How about this one , sir ? ",5

39114, This is a pity ! ,5
39208, I ’ m sorry . I think you are calling the wrong person . My name is not Mr . Bernie . ,5
39209, What ? That ’ s odd . I ’ m so sorry if I ’ Ve bothered you . ,5
39224, I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . ,5
39226, I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight . ,5

69045," Good heavens , am I really ? I'm so sorry , I didn't notice . ",5
69046," I'm sorry , sir , but I'll have to give you a ticket . ",5

70039, It was around 1 thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . ,5
70041, Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . ,5
70086," Don't laugh at me , please . I'm serious . I've never been required to write this kind of report before , I only do the research reports . ",5

71495," Well , actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday . ",5
71497," Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things . ",5
71517, That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday . ,5
71589, I should not have listened to you . ,5
71590, I really thought this was our stop . ,5
71673," In that case , I don't think I'll buy one here . ",5
