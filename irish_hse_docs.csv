https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/register/birth/ 1/3Register a birth
To register a birth, you need to book an appointment to go to a civil registration service. 
You can book an appointment online or by phone. Walk-ins are available in some offices at certain times.
It’s free to register a birth.
To avoid delays, bring all the documents you need to your appointment. Without them, we will not be able to register the birth.
Documents to bring to your appointment
Birth registration form
You must bring a completed birth registration form to your appointment.
If you are registering more than 1 birth, complete a separate form for each baby. For example, twins or triplets. Include on the form
which baby was born first, second or third.
If you had a home birth with a healthcare professional, they should have given you a signed birth notification form. It must
include their registration and PIN. This is a different form to the birth registration form. Bring both forms with you to your
appointment.
If your child is born in a hospital, the staff will send your baby’s birth notification form directly to the civil registration service.
This means you don’t need to bring the birth notification form to your appointment. You just need to bring a completed birth
registration form.

https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/ 1/2Overview
Abdominal aortic aneurysm
An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulge or ballooning of the aorta, the main blood vessel that runs from the heart down
through the chest and tummy.
An AAA expands slowly and rarely needs treatment in people under 60 years old.
It can get bigger over time and could burst (rupture), causing life-threatening bleeding.
Symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
AAAs do not usually cause any obvious symptoms. They are often only picked up during an examination by a GP or more commonly
on tests carried out for another reason. Some people with an AAA have a pulsing sensation visible or palpable in the tummy.
An undetected aneurysm most usually presents when it develops a leak or bursts or ruptures and this usually causes sudden or
severe pain in the left side of the tummy or back.
If there is severe bleeding this can lead to:
sudden, severe pain in the tummy or lower back
dizziness
sweaty, pale and clammy skin
a fast heartbeat
shortness of breath (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/shortness-breath/)
fainting or passing out
When to get medical help
you or someone else develops symptoms of a burst AAA
Make an appointment to see a GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms, especially if you're at a higher risk of an AAA.
You may get an ultrasound scan of your tummy to check if you have an AAA.
Who's at risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
An AAA can form if the sides of the aorta weaken and balloon outwards. It's not always clear why this happens, but there are things
that increase the risk.
People at a higher risk of getting an AAA include men aged 60 or over and women aged 65 or over who have one or more of the
following risk factors:
a family history of AAA
high blood pressure
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
high blood cholesterol
cardiovascular disease, such as heart disease or a history of strokeOverview
Treatment (Link: /conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/treatment/)

https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/ 2/2they smoke or have previously smoked
Speak to a GP if you're worried you may be at risk of an AAA. They may suggest having a scan and making healthy lifestyle
changes to reduce your risk of an AAA.
Treatments for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
The recommended treatment for an AAA depends on how big it is.
Treatment is not always needed straight away if the risk of an AAA bursting is low.
Treatment for a:
small AAA (3cm to 4.4cm ) – ultrasound scans are recommended every year to check if it's getting bigger; you'll get advise
about healthy lifestyle changes to help stop it growing
medium AAA (4.5cm to 5.4cm) – ultrasound scans are recommended every 3 to 6 months to check if it's getting bigger;
you'll also be advised about healthy lifestyle changes
large AAA (5.5cm or more) – surgery to stop it getting bigger or bursting is usually recommended
Ask your doctor if you're not sure what size your AAA is.
Reducing your risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
The most important thing you can do to prevent an aneurysm or to stop one from getting bigger is to make sure your blood pressure
is in normal limits. You can speak to your GP about this if you are concerned. They may recommend taking tablets to treat your
blood pressure.
There are several other things you can do to reduce your chances of getting an AAA or help to stop one getting bigger.
These include:
stopping smoking (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/quit-smoking/)
eating healthily (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/how-to-eat-well.html)
exercising regularly (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/healthy-eating-active-living/exercise/)

development
Social, emotional and behavioural development begins at birth and continues into adulthood.
It means being able to:
express your feelings
trust others
show kindness
have positive interactions with your peers
have a sense of right and wrong
Babies and toddlers learn social and emotional skills from their parents and family.
These skills include:
knowing how to comfort someone who is hurt
learning how to make friends
being able to express worry, anger and happiness
learning how to manage disputes
taking their turn when playing (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/play/learning-through-play/)
following rules and enjoying playtime
Your relationship with your child
The time you spend with your child and how you talk to them will influence their future sense of self. It will also help their social and
emotional development.
By having a secure relationship with you, your child will:
feel more confident exploring their environment
learn about and understand their feelings
begin to form new relationships
be encouraged to become more independent
Understand your child's personality
We inherit some personality traits from our parents. Others are shaped by our world, families and cultures.
It's important to understand your child’s personality. It is unlikely to change.
Spend time with your child
The more time you spend with your child, the more you will understand their personality. This will help you see their strengths as well
as areas where they may need support.
Understanding your child can help you when dealing with their behavioural problems.
Avoid negative comments
Avoid making negative comments about your child's behaviours and personality.
Children are often very sensitive to these comments. They want and need your approval.
The way you think and talk about your child will influence how they view themselves."

Carers Support - Whats Available
The HSE recognises the valuable contribution of carers who care for family members, relatives and friends.
A carer is described as someone who is providing an ongoing signi cant level of care to a person who is in need of care in the home due to illness or disability or
frailty.
The HSE provides health services directly and also funds voluntary organisations to provide supports and services to individuals and their Carers. Your local
Primary Care Team is an invaluable source of information, advice and practical help to support you in your caring role.  The care that family and other carers
provide involves looking after the needs of people with a wide range of care and support needs across all age groups. The type of care provided could include,
personal care, such as bathing, dressing, personal hygiene, preparing meals, helping with feeding, cleaning, shopping and companionship. The support from the
carer enables the persons they are caring for remain at home for as long as safe and practical.  
Carer's Emergency Card
Carry the Carer's Emergency Card (JPG)  (/eng/services/list/3/carerssupport/card.jpg)  so that in case you have an accident or are taken ill, then the details on the
card can be used to make sure the person you care for is looked after.
Are you a Young Carer?
‘Young Carers are children and young people aged under 18 with caring responsibilities who generally provide care for their immediate family such as parents,

The HSE delivers health services through seven hospital groups  (https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals-division/hospital-groups/)  and nine
community health areas called Community Health Organisations (CHOs) across the country.
Acute Hospitals
Acute Hospitals provide inpatient scheduled care, unscheduled/emergency care, maternity services, outpatient and diagnostic services.
Community Health Organisations
Community Health Organisations support people who are dependent at home, and also the family and informal carers who look after them. Core Support"

The Nursing Home Support Scheme  (https://www2.hse.ie/services/fair-deal-scheme/about-the-fair-deal-scheme.html) , also known as the “Fair Deal” scheme is a
scheme of  nancial support for people who need long term residential care services.  Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, people make a contribution
towards the cost of their care and the State pays the balance.
The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is administered by the HSE in line with the legislation (Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009) and within the resources
made available for the Scheme. Further information is available on the HSE website under older people services.  (/eng/services/list/4/olderpeople/)

Caring for someone who cannot manage their own a airs
Wards of Court
If a person with substantial assets is unable to manage their own a airs due to mental incapacity, an application can be made through a solicitor to have the
person made a Ward of Court. If there is no family, sometimes the HSE makes the application. A committee (one or more people, usually the family) is appointed
by the Court to manage the a airs of the Ward. The person then becomes a Ward of Court. All applications are processed through The Wards of Court O ce (01
888 6189). Approximately 30% of all applications to the court involve people with dementia.  Learn more about Wards of Court

https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/pregnancy/ 1/3Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility: COVID-19
vaccination
You should get vaccinated to protect yourself from serious illness with COVID-19 if you are:
pregnant
trying for a baby or might get pregnant in the future (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-
vaccine/get-the-vaccine/pregnancy/#if-you-are-trying-for-a-baby)
breastfeeding (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/pregnancy/#if-you-
are-breastfeeding)
Booster doses while pregnant
If you have never had a COVID-19 booster, you can get a booster at any stage in your pregnancy.
Wait 4 months after your last COVID-19 vaccine or COVID-19 infection.
If you had a booster before this pregnancy
You can get a COVID-19 booster once in this pregnancy. Wait 6 months after your last COVID-19 vaccine or booster.
The best time to get your booster dose is between 20 and 34 weeks. But you can get it at any stage of pregnancy.
If it has been more than 12 months since you had a COVID-19 vaccine or infection, you may be offered a booster dose earlier in
your pregnancy.
If you have a weak immune system
You usually only need one booster dose in pregnancy. But if you have a weak immune system, you can get a second booster 6
months after your last COVID-19 vaccine or infection.
If you have not had any COVID-19 vaccines yet
If you have not had any COVID-19 vaccines, you can get your first round of COVID-19 vaccination at any stage of your pregnancy.
You will be offered 2 doses, 4 to 8 weeks apart.
How to get vaccinated
You can choose to:
go to your GP if they are offering COVID-19 vaccination
book an appointment with a participating pharmacy (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/services/pharmacies-covid-19/)
Which vaccine
You will be offered the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
You may be offered a different type of vaccine if you have an allergy or choose not to get a mRNA vaccine. Talk to your doctor or
vaccinator for advice.
Read about COVID-19 vaccine types (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-types/)
COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines
If you are due to get a flu or pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine, you can get a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time.
Flu vaccines are usually offered between October and April."

https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/pregnancy/ 2/3The whooping cough vaccine is recommended between 16 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. It is usually available throughout the year
from your GP.
If you have recently received a Mpox vaccine (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/monkeypox/vaccine/), wait 4 weeks before you
get the COVID-19 vaccine. This is a precaution because of the unknown risk of myocarditis. Myocarditis is an inflammatory heart
condition.
COVID-19 infection during pregnancy
Most pregnant women who get the virus get mild to moderate symptoms. They give birth as planned and the risk of passing on
COVID-19 to their baby is low.
But you are more likely to get very unwell and need treatment in intensive care than a woman who is not pregnant. The virus may
also cause complications for your baby (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/people-at-higher-risk/covid19-and-pregnancy/).
Vaccination protects you and your baby
Being vaccinated will reduce the chance of you becoming very unwell from COVID-19 and reduce the chance of complications for
your baby.
COVID-19 vaccines are not shown to have any negative effect on babies in the womb. They may help protect your baby after birth
as you may pass on antibodies from the vaccine to your baby.
Children under the age of 1 are at higher risk of hospitalisation and severe illness from COVID-19. Young babies whose mothers
were vaccinated in pregnancy were less likely to need hospital care with COVID-19.
Getting a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy gives you, and your baby, the best possible protection from COVID-19
Read more about COVID-19 and pregnancy (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/people-at-higher-risk/covid19-and-
pregnancy/)
Evidence shows COVID-19 vaccines are safe
Pregnant women in Ireland have been safely getting the COVID-19 vaccine since May 2021. There has been no increase in
reported side effects from COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women or their babies anywhere in the world.
But COVID-19 vaccines are new. We are still learning about them. There is limited data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in
pregnancy. They were not tested on pregnant women during clinical trials.
The COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines. This means they cannot give you or your baby COVID-19. The vaccine doses are
rapidly broken down in your body. They cannot become part of your or your baby’s DNA.
If you decide not to get vaccinated
You may decide to wait until your baby is born or until you have more information before getting a vaccine.
If you wait, there is a greater risk you will become very unwell if you get COVID-19. There are also risks for your baby.
Take extra care to protect yourself against COVID-19 (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/preventing-the-spread/protect-
yourself-and-others/) if you decide not to get vaccinated.
Avoid situations where you could pick up the virus. This includes crowded areas.
If you are trying for a baby
You do not need to leave any gap between having your COVID-19 vaccine and:
trying to get pregnant
having fertility treatment (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/fertility/fertility-treatment/), such as IVF
Fertility and COVID-19 vaccination
There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination affects fertility. Do not put off having a vaccine because you are hoping to get
pregnant.
If you are breastfeeding
You can get a COVID-19 vaccine if you are breastfeeding. This will protect you from getting seriously unwell due to COVID-19.
You can continue to breastfeed safely after being vaccinated."
21,"05/11/2023, 14:23 Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility: COVID-19 vaccination - HSE.ie
https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/pregnancy/ 3/3COVID-19 vaccines do not affect breastfed babies. There is no known reason to avoid breastfeeding if you are vaccinated.
Getting a vaccine cannot infect your baby with COVID-19.
If you were vaccinated while pregnant, antibodies against COVID-19 may pass into your first breast milk or colostrum (Link:
https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/breastfeeding/a-good-start/your-first-breast-milk-or-colostrum/). This may give some protection
from the virus to your baby.
Side effects
Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects. Most of these are mild to moderate and do not last long.
You can take paracetamol if you have a fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or higher). Do not take ibuprofen or aspirin.

If you are worried about your child, do not hesitate to contact your GP or public health nurse for advice.
Many GPs will give advice over the phone or will try to fit a baby or young child in without an appointment.
They would prefer to advise you now and prevent a child from getting seriously unwell later.
If you need urgent help

When to see your GP soon
Make an appointment to see your GP if your:
baby is not gaining weight or is losing weight
child has pain that's keeping them awake
child has a cough that is not going away or a mild wheeze
When to get help in the next few days
You may want to get advice from your GP or pharmacist if your child has:
a sore ear or a sore throat
vomiting or diarrhoea but is able to keep fluids down
a mild fever (a temperature of less than 38 degrees Celsius) that is lasting for more than 2 to 3 days
If you cannot get an appointment
If you cannot get an appointment with your GP, ask if another GP can see you.
Phone the GP out-of-hours service in your area if your GP surgery is closed and your child needs to be seen urgently.

spreading COVID-19 to others
If your child is vaccinated they will be less likely to miss school, childcare and other activities because of being ill with COVID-19.
COVID-19 and children
Most children who get COVID-19 have very mild symptoms or no symptoms.
But children who get COVID-19 need to avoid contact with other people even if their symptoms are mild.
If your child has COVID-19 (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/if-you-have-covid-19/children/)
Serious illness is rare
COVID-19 rarely causes serious illness, hospitalisation or death in children.
The risk of a child being hospitalised because of COVID-19 is low, and the risk of any child needing intensive care treatment is
extremely low.
Serious illness and hospitalisation rates are low for children age 6 months to 4 years. But they are higher than in older children.
Children with certain health conditions are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (Link:
https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/people-at-higher-risk/overview/#conditions-that-put-you-at-higher-risk). They are more likely
to have to go to hospital with COVID-19.
Sometimes, symptoms connected to COVID-19 can continue for some weeks or months. This is called ‘long COVID (Link:
https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/long-covid/)’. The risk of having this is lower in children compared to adults.
PIMS or MIS-C
In rare cases, COVID-19 can cause a condition called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS). PIMS is also known
as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). It causes pneumonia, inflammation of the heart and difficulty breathing."

https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/covid-19-vaccination-for-children/ 2/5PIMS is more rarely seen following Omicron variant COVID-19 infection.
COVID-19 vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of PIMS in older children and adolescents and a similar benefit is
expected in children age 6 months to 4 years.
3 out of 4 children who develop PIMS or MIS-C have no underlying health condition. Most children with PIMS recover after time in
hospital or intensive care. But some children have lasting side effects and a very small number can die.
This condition is known to affect children as young as 3 months.
If your child is age 6 months to 11 years and had PIMS, they can get a COVID-19 vaccine. They should wait until they have
recovered and at least 90 days after they were diagnosed.
Vaccine type
Your child will be offered the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-
vaccine/vaccine-types/).
Children aged 5 and older may be offered the adapted Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for their first round of vaccination. The adapted
vaccines work in the same way as the original Pfizer vaccine. But they are expected to give better protection against COVID-19,
including the Omicron variant.
Adapted mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been recommended for children aged 5 and older by the National Immunisation Advisory
Committee (NIAC) in Ireland.
Dose amount
The dose amount they are offered depends on their age.
Children aged:
12 to 17 are given the same dose amount as all people age 12 and older
5 to 11 are given a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine with a smaller dose
6 months to 4 years are given a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine with an even smaller dose
The immunity they get will be similar to the higher dose vaccine used in older age groups.
When your child will be due dose 2 or dose 3 (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-
vaccine/children/#doses-needed)
Vaccine safety
Clinical trials showed that this vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID-19 in children.
6 months to 4 years
At least 1 dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (the same type as the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Link:
https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-types/)) has already been given to over 1 million children
age 6 months to 4 years in the USA. Over 3,000 children have been vaccinated as part of clinical trials. No new safety concerns
were reported in children age 6 months to 4 years after these trials.
5 to 11 years
This vaccine has been given to millions of children age 5 to 11 in the USA, Canada and Israel and is recommended in other
European countries.
Thousands of people worldwide have been vaccinated as part of clinical trials. No new safety concerns were reported in children
age 5 to 11 after these trials.
European Medicines Agency information about the Pfizer/BioNTech (Comirnaty) COVID-19 vaccine - ema.europa.eu (Link:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comirnaty)
It is expected that the safety of the adapted vaccines will be similar to the previous vaccines. The safety of COVID-19 vaccines will
continue to be monitored by the EMA.

https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/covid-19-vaccination-for-children/ 3/5Most children age 6 months and older will be able to safely get the vaccine.
But the Pfizer/BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine is not recommended if your child had a severe allergic reaction to:
any of the ingredients in the vaccine, including polyethylene glycol (PEG)
a previous dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine
a previous dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine
Trometamol (one of the contents in contrast dye used in MRI scans)
Talk to your child’s GP before getting the vaccine if your child has had:
a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) in the past, including to any other vaccine or medication
myocarditis or pericarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) after a previous dose of any COVID-19 vaccine
Your GP will likely refer your child to a cardiologist (heart specialist).
If your child is getting other vaccines
If your child under age 5 is getting their routine childhood vaccines (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/vaccines-your-child/),
they should wait 14 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine.
If your child recently had a COVID-19 infection (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-
vaccine/children/#if-your-child-recently-had-a-covid-19-infection)
Side effects in children
Vaccines can cause side effects. Most of these are mild or moderate in children and do not last long. Side effects can include a sore
arm, fever or tiredness.
Read about potential side effects after the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-
vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/side-effects/)
Myocarditis and pericarditis
In rare cases, people may develop myocarditis and pericarditis after getting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Myocarditis and pericarditis
are inflammatory heart conditions.
Myocarditis in children aged 6 months to 11 years is very rare.
In the USA, over a million doses of mRNA vaccines have been given to children in this age group. There have been no
reports of myocarditis in these children.
We are still learning about the effectiveness and side effects of COVID-19 vaccines in this age group.
Early data from other countries shows myocarditis is less likely in those age 12 to 15 than those aged 16 to 24.
The risk of these very rare conditions is higher in younger men. They are more likely to happen after the second dose and
mostly happen within 14 days of getting the vaccine.
2 European studies have estimated the risk of myocarditis, after the second dose of the vaccine:
1 additional case for every 38,000 males age 12 to 29 (within 7 days)
1 additional case for every 17,500 males age 16 to 24 (within 28 days)
The risk of these rare side effects seems to be lower after the first booster.
Even though these conditions are rare, you should know the signs to look out for in your child after vaccination.6 months to 11 years

breathlessness
palpitations (a forceful heartbeat that may be irregular)
chest pain
Signs of myocarditis in younger children may be more general including:
irritability
vomiting
difficulty feeding
rapid and shallow breathing
fatigue
Most people recover from myocarditis and pericarditis on their own. But some may need treatment in hospital. We don’t
know yet if there are any long-term problems because of these side effects.
If you decide not to get your child vaccinated
You may decide to wait until more information is available about COVID-19 vaccines in children before deciding to get a vaccine.
If you decide not to get your child vaccinated, there is a greater risk they could get COVID-19. Their symptoms will most likely be
mild, but they will still need to isolate from others. This means they may miss school, childcare and other activities.
You will need to take extra care to protect your child against COVID-19 (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/preventing-the-
spread/protecting-your-child/).
Different views between parents
Children under 16 will need the consent of one parent or legal guardian to get vaccinated.
If you're a parent or guardian and do not agree about getting your child vaccinated, discuss and try to resolve this between
yourselves before booking an appointment for your child.
You can also talk to your child’s GP about any concerns you may have about COVID-19 vaccines.
Talk to your child about vaccination as their opinion is important also.
If a vaccinator, including your GP or pharmacist, is notified that one parent or guardian does not consent to the child being
vaccinated, the vaccine should not be given.

https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abortion/how-to-get/when/ 1/2When you can have an abortion
An abortion is the medical process of ending a pregnancy. It's also known as a termination.
The pregnancy ends either by:
taking medicine (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abortion/methods/medical/)
having a minor surgical procedure (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abortion/methods/surgical/)
An abortion is free through the HSE if you live in the Republic of Ireland.
If you live outside the Republic of Ireland, you can have an abortion in the Republic of Ireland. But you will have to pay for it.
Having an abortion
You can have an abortion if your pregnancy is no more than 12 weeks.
12 weeks of pregnancy means 84 days since the first day of your last period.
After 12 weeks, you can only have an abortion in exceptional circumstances (Link:
https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abortion/methods/after-12-weeks/).
The earlier an abortion is carried out, the simpler and safer it will be.
Getting support early on will also give you more time to make a decision if you're unsure whether you want to have an abortion or
not.
You can get free and confidential advice on all your options from My Options (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/services/unplanned-
pregnancy-support-services/my-options-freephone-line.html). This is the HSE support service.
Call My Options on Freephone 1800 828 010 (Link: tel:1800828010). From outside the Republic of Ireland call 00353 59 916 5066
(Link: tel:00353599138175)
3-day wait
You can have an abortion up to 12 weeks (84 days) of pregnancy.
But you need to begin the process earlier than that.
This is so a GP or doctor can certify that you are no more than 12 weeks pregnant. There must be at least 3 days between being
certified and having the abortion procedure. This is the law.
For example, if you are certified on a Monday, the earliest you can have an abortion is Thursday.
This delay of at least 3 days can give you time to decide if you want to go ahead with the abortion.
Deciding to have an abortion (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abortion/how-to-get/deciding/)
Certification
You need to get 'certification' from a GP or doctor before you have an abortion. This is the law.
A GP or doctor needs to certify that you will be no more than 12 weeks pregnant at the time of the abortion. They will do this check
during your pre-abortion consultation (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abortion/methods/before/).
You should have this consultation to get certified as early as you can. This is because there may be a delay in certifying that you are
no more than 12 weeks pregnant. This delay can happen if the GP or doctor needs to refer you for an ultrasound scan (Link:
https://www2.hse.ie/pregnancy-birth/scans-tests/ultrasound-scans/).
There may be delays in getting an appointment with your GP or doctor. They may not be able to see you at short notice. This could
delay an abortion."

Working out how many weeks pregnant you are
The length of your pregnancy is the number of days since the first day of your last period.
9 weeks of pregnancy means 63 days since the first day of your last period.
12 weeks of pregnancy means 84 days since the first day of your last period.
If you're not sure how long you've been pregnant, you may need an ultrasound scan to check. Your GP or doctor can refer you.
Ultrasound scan
Your doctor may refer you for an ultrasound scan if:
you do not know how many weeks pregnant you are
your cycle is irregular
your doctor is concerned about an ectopic pregnancy (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/)
This will help you and your doctor decide which abortion method (Link:

https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abortion/how-to-get/risks/ 1/2Risks of an abortion
Abortions are generally very safe. Most women will not experience any problems.
But like any medical treatment, there is a small risk that something could go wrong.
Possible complications
The risk of complications increases the later in pregnancy you have an abortion.
Possible complications include:
the pregnancy is not completely removed
infection of the womb
haemorrhage or very heavy bleeding during the abortion
heavy or irregular bleeding after the abortion
mental health problems such as feeling down or upset
continuing pregnancy
If complications do happen, you may need further treatment, including surgery.
Effect on fertility and future pregnancies
Having an abortion will not affect your chances of becoming pregnant. You should be able to have normal pregnancies in the future.
Abortion does not increase your risk of:
miscarriage (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/miscarriage/)
ectopic pregnancy (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/)
problems with the placenta (afterbirth)
Many women are able to get pregnant immediately afterwards. Start using contraception (Link:
https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-health/contraception/) right away if you do not want this to happen.
Talk to your GP or doctor if you're concerned about the risks of an abortion.
Physical side effects after an abortion (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abortion/after/physical-side-effects/)
Mental health effects
You may have a range of emotions after you have an abortion.
If you need to, you can talk to a counsellor for free about how you're feeling.
Call the My Options helpline on Freephone: 1800 828 010 (Link: tel:1800828010).
You are not more likely to have a mental health problem if you have an abortion. You are just as likely to have a mental health
problem if you continued with the pregnancy.
You can also talk to your GP if you have any concerns.
Emotional side effects after an abortion (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abortion/after/emotional-side-effects/)

The protection from previous doses or a COVID-19 infection may weaken over time. Booster doses help boost your antibodies and
give you good protection from becoming seriously ill or needing to go to hospital if you get COVID-19.
A first booster is recommended for all adults age 18 years and older.
After this, seasonal boosters are recommended for some people at higher risk of COVID-19 illness.
Who can get an autumn booster
Autumn booster doses are available now.
You will be offered a booster dose if you are:
age 50 or older
age 5 or older with a weak immune system (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-

Read about booster doses needed during pregnancy (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-
the-vaccine/pregnancy/#booster-doses-while-pregnant).
If you're age 18 to 49 and not in one of the groups above, you can still request a vaccine. Talk to your GP or pharmacist about your
reasons for wanting a booster.
You can get your COVID-19 booster and flu vaccine at the same time (Link:
https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/covid-19-
vaccine-booster-dose/#covid-19-booster-and-flu-vaccine).
How long to wait
You have to leave some time between your booster and your last COVID-19 vaccine or COVID-19 infection.
How long to wait depends on your age, if you are pregnant or if you have a weak immune system (Link:
https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/weak-immune-system/).
It is recommended to wait 6 months since your last COVID-19 vaccine or COVID-19 infection.
But you can get your booster at least 3 months after your last COVID-19 vaccine or infection if you need protection sooner.
Talk to your GP or pharmacist for advice.
It is recommended to wait 9 months since your last COVID-19 vaccine or COVID-19 infection.
But you can get your booster at least 3 months after your last COVID-19 vaccine or infection if you need protection sooner.
Talk to your GP or pharmacist for advice.
There is different advice if you are:

Wait 4 months after your last COVID-19 vaccine or COVID-19 infection.
For some people who need protection sooner, you can get your first booster 3 months after your last COVID-19 vaccine or infection.
People under 16 must attend their booster appointment with a parent or guardian. A parent or guardian will need to give consent for
their child’s vaccination (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/children/#giving-
consent-for-vaccination).
Which vaccine you will be offered
You will be offered an adapted Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as a booster dose. This is an mRNA vaccine.
Adapted vaccines work in the same way as the original Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. But they are expected to give even more
protection against COVID-19 variants, including Omicron variants.
You may get a non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, if an mRNA vaccine is not suitable, or you choose not to have an mRNA vaccine.
Read more about COVID-19 vaccine types (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-types/).
COVID-19 booster and flu vaccine
You can get your COVID-19 booster and flu vaccine (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/flu/vaccine/) at the same time.
You may experience an increase in side effects after getting both vaccines together. These will be mild and should not last long.
Side effects may include:
pain in your arm (or arms) where you had the vaccines
fatigue (feeling tired)
headache
muscle aches and pain
If you feel uncomfortable, take paracetamol or ibuprofen following the instructions on the box or leaflet.

https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/covid-19-vaccine-booster-dose/ 3/4Booster dose safety
Many countries have given multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccines. There have not been any unexpected safety concerns so far. The
safety of the vaccines continues to be monitored by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The side effects of the adapted
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are similar to the original vaccines. The most regularly reported side effects are headache, fever, and
tiredness.
Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory heart conditions and are very rare risks of mRNA vaccines. These rare side effects are
more common in men under the age of 30 years after their second primary vaccine dose. The risk of these side effects appears to
be lower after the first booster.

effects/#side-effects-of-covid-19-vaccines)
If you have had anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) to trometamol, you should not get an adapted vaccine.
If you have any concerns about getting a booster, talk to your GP, nurse, pharmacist or vaccinator.
After your COVID-19 booster dose
You need to wait for 15 minutes after the vaccine. This is to make sure that you feel well before you leave.
If you have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) in the past, you'll need to wait 30 minutes.
Get medical care immediately if you:
have difficulty breathing
feel dizzy
have a fast heartbeat or a skin rash
These could be a sign of an allergic reaction. But severe allergic reactions are rare.
If you were vaccinated in a different country
If you were vaccinated abroad, you can get your booster here if you are due one.
You will need your vaccination details including vaccine type, date given and expiry date.
If you do not have a PPS number, you can still get vaccinated. You will need to bring photo ID and proof of address.
Your proof of address can be a:
household bill in your name
bank or financial institution statement
letter from a public service department or agency
rental agreement
letter from the owner of the property to confirm you live there - this can be your parent
bill or letter from a hotel or Airbnb

https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/register/death/ 1/2Register a death
To register a death, you need to book an appointment to go to a civil registration service. 
You can book an appointment online or by phone. Walk-ins are available in some offices at certain times.
It’s free to register a death.
To avoid delays, bring all the documents you need to your appointment. Without them, we will not be able to register the death.
Who can register a death
Any family member or relative can register a death.
A ‘qualified informant’ can also register a death.
This includes:
a person who was there at the time of death
anyone with the deceased person’s details - their PPS number, place of birth, parents' names, job, civil status
a chief officer or authorised person in a hospital, institution or organisation
a person who found or took charge of the body
any other person who has knowledge of the death
When to register a death
By law, you must register the death within 12 months. If you need to register a death after 12 months, phone the civil registration
service for advice.
Documents to bring to your appointment
Photo ID
Bring the original of any of the following forms of photo ID:
passport
driver's licence
refugee asylum card
national ID card from a country where it is an accepted form of travel document
public services card
The ID is for the person who is registering the death, not the person who died.
Death notification form
If a person dies in a hospital or nursing home, the hospital or doctor will give the form to the next-of-kin or another relative.
The GP or doctor will have completed Part 1 of the form. You must then complete Part 2 of the form before you attend the
appointment.
If someone dies outside of these places, the death is sometimes referred to the coroner.

If a death is referred to the coroner, there may be a delay in registering their death. The coroner will tell you how long this might take.
They may give you an interim death certificate. This can be used to close bank and credit union accounts or to cancel social welfare

If there is an inquest or post-mortem, the coroner will send the civil registration service a certificate. We will then register the death.
You do not need to do anything else.

An abortion is a very safe procedure with a low risk of complications. 
Some people may be sure they want to have an abortion. Others may find it more difficult to make a decision.
The decision to have an abortion is yours alone. But you should discuss your options with a healthcare professional.
Where to get support
Call My Options, our free unplanned pregnancy support service, on freephone 1800 828 010 (Link: tel:1800 828 010).
From outside the Republic of Ireland call 00 353 59 916 5066 (Link: tel:00 353 59 916 5066).
Unbiased information and support is also available from:
some GPs that provide abortion services (call the My Options team for information on which GPs or doctors offer these
services in your local area)
family planning clinics
women's health clinics
You may also want to speak to your partner, friends or family. But you do not need to discuss it with anyone else and they do not
have a say in the final decision.
When you can have an abortion (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abortion/how-to-get/when/)
Under 18 years
If you are under 18 years old, you are encouraged to involve your parents or another supportive adult.
If you are over 16 years old and you choose not to involve an adult, a doctor can still offer you an abortion.
But this is only if they are confident that you understand the information and you can give consent. This is so that they know that you
can make your own decision.
If you are aged 15 or under and you choose not to involve your parents or another supportive adult, a doctor can still offer you an
abortion.
But only if:
there are exceptional circumstances (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abortion/methods/after-12-weeks/)
you have had an assessment with a doctor
Confidentiality
If you decide to have an abortion, you have the right for your information to remain confidential.
But your doctor must report to Tusla - The Child and Family Agency (Link: https://www.tusla.ie/) if:
you are under 15 and have had sex
you are aged 15 or 16 and having sex with someone who is at least 2 years older than you
you are under 17 and the doctor believes you are at risk of sexual abuse or harm
you are under 17 and the doctor believes you have been sexually abused or harmed

We understand that people ask for abortions for many different reasons.
If something has happened or there is something that your GP or doctor should be aware of, please let them know.

https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/communication-development/12-24-months/ 1/312 to 24 months: how to help your child's communication
Just like when they were a baby, your toddler’s communication will thrive through your spending time with them. It is important that
you continue to tune into their facial expressions and sounds.
Show interest in what they are doing and respond to them by:
describing your daily activities together, for example “that’s the car” and “we’re changing your nappy”
adding words to your toddler’s sentences, for example if they say “kick ball” you could say “yes, mammy is kicking the ball”
– this helps them to use longer sentences when they are ready
Use actions with your words
Using actions with your words makes it easier for your toddler to understand your words. It also gives them more ways to
communicate with you.
Examples of actions you can use:
wave when you say “bye bye”
shake your head when you say “no”
show size with your hands when you say ""big"" or ""small""
lift your arms up when you say ""up""
Make sure to use the same action with the same word each time.
Give “it” a name
Instead of saying “there it is”, you could say “there’s the ball” or “there’s the bubble”. This will help them to become familiar with a
range of specific words.
Speak slowly and clearly
When talking with your toddler, speak slowly and clearly, so that they have the best opportunity to hear the sounds at the beginning,
middle and end of the words. This will help to develop their speech sounds.
Stay calm when they’re being challenging
Staying calm will help your toddler to learn how to deal with emotions and emotions. It also encourages good self-esteem and sets a
strong foundation for their growing communication and later speech and language development.

https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/communication-development/12-24-months/ 2/3Use words to describe your toddler’s feelings
Name the emotions your toddler is experiencing, for example, happy, excited, sad or upset. This gives your child the words to
understand and talk about their own and others’ feelings. This is very important for your child’s emotional awareness and
development.
Limit screen time
Screens can be smartphones, gaming devices, tablets, computers and televisions. Try to limit screen time to under one hour per day
for 18 to 24 month olds. It is not recommended for children under 18 months to have any screen time.
Watching too much on screens can take time away from special interactions with your toddler that are important for speech and
language development.
Screen time and young children (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/play/screen-time/)
Limit soothers
Try to limit your toddler’s use of soothers, especially when they are awake. Soothers can lead to difficulties with their teeth and
speech.
Activities to try
Ideas to help your toddler's communication include:
Action songs and nursery rhymes
Sing action songs and nursery rhymes with your toddler. Repeat the same songs and go slowly, so that your toddler can become
familiar with the rhythm.
“This little piggy went to the market...” is a fun rhyme to sing during nappy change or after bath time. When your toddler starts using
their first words, try leaving out the last word of the rhyme for your toddler to say, for example: “They all fall…”
Books
Most toddlers enjoy books with simple stories or about their favourite characters. Encourage them to join in for repetitive lines of the
story. It is best to follow your toddler’s interest in the book – this may involve describing the pictures instead of reading the story.
Floor play
Play on the floor with your toddler, they can learn so much language through play.

and to support their growing speech and language development.

Speaking more than one language at home
Many children grow up in a family where more than one language is spoken every day. Young children adapt very well and pick up
different languages quickly.
The important thing is to speak to your child in the language that you feel at ease with. This might mean you use one language and
your partner uses another language when you talk with your child.

Your relationship and interactions with your child are what’s most important in helping their speech, language and communication
develop.
You can support your child’s communication by:
talking to them about everyday activities and routines, for example “after we visit Granny, we will go to the shops”
starting with a comment instead of a question so you child answers with more than just ""yes"" or ""no"" -instead of asking, ""is
that a sand castle?” say, “I see you are building a lovely sand castle. Tell me about it”
having 10 minutes “special time” in which you play an activity that your child has chosen
modelling correct grammar or pronunciation if your child makes a mistake such as saying “oh yes, the boy fell off the wall”
if your child says “the boy falled off the wall” - it can help to repeat the correct word a few times
repeating your child’s sentences and adding extra words or new ideas - for example if your child says, “look at the tiger”,
you could say “oh wow, look at the stripy tiger. I wonder what he likes to eat”
making up stories together – think of new and interesting characters and places
playing word games and sound games like ""words that start with b"" and ""words that rhyme with cat"" and word meaning
games, for example ""name 5 animals""
playing games like “Simon says” to help your child to understand and follow simple instructions
reading books together and then talking about the story and what you think might happen next

“I I I I I I want that”.
This is because your child’s language is developing so quickly at this time.
You can help them by:
listening to what your child has said and not how they have said it
keeping eye contact and letting them know that they has lots of time to finish
speaking slowly with your child and asking fewer questions

Mental health crisis
A mental health crisis often means that you no longer feel able to cope or be in control of your situation.
In a crisis, it is important that you get help as soon as possible.
You may be:
feeling severe emotional distress or anxiety
feeling unable to cope with demands of daily life or work
thinking about suicide or self-harm
having unusual experiences or beliefs, such as hearing voices, or thinking people are out to get you
A mental health crisis can also be the result of an underlying medical condition.
For example, confusion or delusions caused by:
an infection
an overdose
illicit drugs
intoxication with alcohol
Confusion can also be a symptom of dementia.

https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/first-aid/first-aid-kit-child/ 1/3First aid kit for babies and children
Children can be at risk of injuries (accidents) in the home. Most are not serious, but it is worth keeping a first aid kit. This will help
you deal with minor injuries.
First aid does not replace medical care. Seek medical help if you think an injury is serious. Phone 112 or 999 in an
emergency.
When to get medical help for your child (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/first-aid/when-to-see-your-gp/)
Your first aid box should be waterproof and easy to carry. Keep it locked and store it out of the reach of children.
If someone else is caring for your children, let them know where you keep the kit. Many people also keep a small first aid kit in their
car for emergencies.
Do not store medicine in your first aid kit. This is because a child might take medicine from it. Keep all medicine in a locked
cupboard.
Wash your hands properly before and after giving first aid.
Check use-by dates
Remember to keep your first aid kit up to date. Replace used items and check use-by dates of all medicines held in your locked
cupboard. Throw away anything past its use-by date.
First aid manual
It can be hard to remember what to do when you're in a panic and your child is crying. An easy-to-use guide can help refresh your
memory . Print out the HSE child safety first aid guide (PDF, 3.1 MB, 4 pages) (Link: /documents/67/child-safety-wallchart-for-
parents-including-basic-first-aid.pdf) and keep it with your first aid box.
Emergency phone numbers list
Put a list of emergency phone numbers into the kit.
The numbers should include:
112 and 999
your home's Eircode (Link: https://www.eircode.ie/)
your nearest emergency department (ED) (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/services/emergency-departments/) that sees children

https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/first-aid/first-aid-kit-child/ 2/3You can also keep a list of these numbers close to your landline.
Dressings
Include the following things in your first aid kit:
plasters - buy them in a variety of sizes for minor cuts, blisters and sore spots
adhesive tape - this can hold dressings in place and you can also apply it to smaller cuts
crepe bandages - these are useful for support or holding a dressing in place
tubular bandages - these are helpful when a child has strained a joint and needs extra support
triangular bandages - you can use these for making a sling
sterile gauze dressings - these are good for covering larger sore areas and cuts
scissors for cutting clothes, plasters and tape to size
safety pins - you can use these to secure an arm sling in place around the elbow area
Tweezers
You use tweezers to remove thorns, splinters and ticks. Never use tweezers to remove objects from your child's nose, mouth or ears
– get medical help instead.
Hand sanitiser
Remember to wash your hands before and after you give first aid. If you do not have access to water, hand sanitiser is a good
option.
Disposable gloves
Gloves can protect you from infection when giving first aid. They also protect the injured person if they have open wounds or are
bleeding.
Use sterile-type gloves when dealing with open wounds.
You can use non-sterile gloves if you need to protect yourself only. For example, when cleaning up blood spills, or dealing with poo
and vomit.
Antiseptic cream or spray
Antiseptic cream or spray can be applied to minor cuts or grazes after cleaning. This will help prevent infection. Some may also help
to numb pain.
The best first aid treatment for burns is placing it under cool running water for 20 minutes. Only use burn gels or hydrogels if you are
not near cool running water. Apply cool running water when it is available.
Antiseptic wipes
Antiseptic wipes are a handy way to clean minor cuts and grazes and help prevent infection. To use them, take a fresh wipe and
clean the wound. Work gently away from the centre to remove dirt and germs. Always follow manufacturer instructions on the
package.
Absorbent pads
Use absorbent pads to lightly apply pressure to a wound that is bleeding. Do this until the bleeding stops. Make sure there is nothing
stuck in the wound first.
Thermometer
Use a digital or electronic thermometer. These are quick and accurate. You can also use them under the armpit. Always place the
thermometer under the armpit for children under 5. Always follow the manufacturer instructions.

Saline solution and eye bath
This is useful for washing bits of dust or loose particles out of sore eyes.
For your fridge and freezer
You can use ice packs or a packet of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel for minor head injuries. These can be used for short
periods of time regularly for the first few days. They will help to bring down any swelling.
For when you're out and about
If you are away from home, you might not be able to access clean water.
The following items may be useful to include in your first aid kit:
burn gel
sterile water, in a sealed disposable container, for wound cleaning
hand sanitiser

your child stops breathing or becomes unresponsive
Ask for an ambulance.
Give them your exact location or Eircode (Link: https://www.eircode.ie/) if possible.
Start CPR straight away
CPR is also known as mouth-to-mouth. It's a mix of mouth-to-mouth rescue breaths and chest compressions.
A chest compression is when you apply pressure to someone's chest.
You do this to keep blood and oxygen flowing in the body.
You don't have to do mouth-to-mouth part to save a life, but you must do the compressions.
Do CPR until help arrives
Stay on the phone. The emergency  call operator will guide you on what to do next.
They'll give you instructions on how to perform CPR, if it's needed.
It is crucial to continue CPR until paramedics arrive.
Even though you are still on the call, ambulance paramedics are on their way to you.
Giving CPR to a child aged 1 year and older

https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/communication-development/0-12-months/ 1/3Helping your child's communication development: 0 to
12 months
Your baby loves following your cues. Watch and tune into your baby’s facial expressions, eye and body movements.
Ask yourself what your baby is thinking, feeling or showing interest in.
Respond to your baby by:
talking to them about what they are interested in - for example, “You’re looking at the light”
going slowly at their pace - they need time to process new experiences and words
getting face to face, making eye contact and smiling – find a comfortable distance (approximately arm’s length) that allows
your baby to focus on your face
listening to your baby and leaving little pauses for them to take their turn - this shows them that you are interested in their
thoughts and feelings
copying their sounds and actions and waiting to see how your baby responds - if they say ""bababa"", repeat it back to them
comforting them when they cry - this helps set a strong foundation for their communication development, make your baby
to feel safe and secure and build healthy self-esteem
Your baby's mental health (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/parenting-advice/baby-and-child-mental-wellbeing/help-your-
child-manage-feelings/)
Your child's social, emotional and behavioural development (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/social-
emotional-behavioural/)
Speaking your native language
Talk to your baby in your native language. In two-parent families, this could mean your baby is exposed to two or more languages
from birth. For example, if one parent speaks with baby in their native Polish and the other parent talk to them in their native English.
This is best for their speech and language development.
Activities to try
You can also do fun activities with your baby to help them develop speech and languages, such singing nursery rhymes.
Songs and nursery rhymes
Sing songs and nursery rhymes with your baby. It's a fun way to repeat words and use actions with words.
Watch a video on using repetition to help your child's communication (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=DgVPPngyWDY&list=PLsQK32cdMW_ygwiXLtpIu11owvqX8HctB&index=5)
Picture books
Snuggle up and share a picture book together. Allow your baby to hold the book. Notice what your baby is interested in and talk
about that for example, “You see the monkey!”
At this stage, this is more important than reading the words in the book.
Play on the floor
Your baby can learn so much language through playing with you. At this stage, your baby might enjoy touching or holding little toys
with different feels, like soft blocks or a rattle.
Pace your play to suit your baby. You can repeat lots of new words, for example “shake shake” or “the ball feels squishy!”

https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/communication-development/0-12-months/ 2/3Social games like “Peek-a-boo” are a lot of fun and a great way to encourage your baby’s communication and concentration.
Sensory books
Your baby will really enjoy ‘touch and feel’ sensory books. Allow your baby to hold the book and notice how they look at the pictures
and touch the pages. Notice what your baby is interested in and talk about that, for example “the cat feels furry!”
Blocks
Your baby might enjoy banging blocks together or putting blocks into a cup. They might like to play with a ball, a pop-up toy or
bubbles with you.
These games allow you to repeat lots of new words such as “the block is in the cup” or “pop the bubble”.
Offer choices
Offering choices between 2 items can make it easier for your child to communicate what they want. You can also use choices to
model words and gestures.
To start with, offer something they like with something they don't like or something unexpected. For example, ask them if they want
to play with bubbles or a sock.

https://www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/medical-cards/applying/how-much-you-can-earn/ 1/3How much you can earn and still qualify for a medical
card
The online application process includes a quick assessment of your finances. This will let you know if you might qualify for a medical
card or GP visit card. It is based on basic income and expenses information.
A full assessment is carried out later in the application process. You will need to upload documents showing income and expenses.
For example, payslip, proof of social welfare payment, childcare costs etc.
How much you can earn
Your qualifying financial threshold is the amount you can earn a week and still qualify for a card.
How we calculate this
Your qualifying financial threshold is calculated by adding the following 3 amounts:
A basic rate - an amount of money depending on your circumstances.
The amount allocated for each dependant.
The amount for allowable expenses.
The 3 amounts are added together to give you a qualifying financial threshold. This figure is the maximum amount you can earn as
your net weekly income in order to qualify for a medical card.
Qualifying financial threshold
Basic rate amount + amount for dependants + allowable expenses = amount you can earn a
week and qualify for a card
The basic rate is a fixed amount. It is determined by your age, marital status, living situation and if you have any children. It is
lower for a medical card than it is for a GP visit card.
Basic rates:
Single person living alone aged up to 65: €184 for medical card and €304 for GP visit card
Single person living alone aged 66 and over: €201.50 for medical card and €333 for GP visit card
Single person living with family aged up to 65: €164 for medical card and €271 for GP visit card
Single person living with family aged 66 and over: €173.50 for medical card and €286 for GP visit card
Married, co-habiting couple/single parent family aged up to 65 with dependents: €266.50 for medical card
and €441 for GP visit card

COVID-19 vaccination is available to children aged 6 months and older to give them protection against serious COVID-19 illness.
For people under 16, a parent or legal guardian must book their appointment and give consent for their vaccination.
How to get your child vaccinated
There are different ways to get your child vaccinated, depending on their age.
For children age 6 months to 11 years, you can:
book a vaccination centre appointment (Link: https://covid19booster.healthservice.ie/hse-self-referral/?flow=booster)

19-vaccination-centre/) - when they are open
Children under 12 must go to a vaccination centre for their vaccine. This is because children under 12 are given a vaccine with a
smaller dose.
If your child is 12 or older, you can:
book an appointment with a participating pharmacy (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/services/pharmacies-covid-19/)
go to your GP, if they are offering COVID-19 vaccines
If you have any questions about where to get your child vaccinated, call HSELive for advice. Freephone: 1800 700 700 (Link:

When the situation is very difficult, it can be hard to imagine a different life. But change is possible, for you and the person drinking.
There are ways to cope better when someone close to you is drinking in a harmful way. Building your coping skills and asking for
help will make a difference.
Look after your own needs
Family members living with dependent drinkers often neglect themselves. They can be too busy looking after the other person or
taking on extra responsibilities.
Remember:
you did not cause it
you cannot control it
you cannot cure it
Put yourself and others affected first.
Make sure you and others affected:
ask for help
get enough sleep
eat well
take time away from the problems, even by going for a walk or visiting a friend
Recognise that harmful drinking affects you too
You may experience violence or financial problems.
But there may also be less obvious effects, such as:
missing sleep
feeling worn out, afraid, anxious or resentful
Try to recognise and express your feelings.
Keep yourself and others safe from harm
Contact the Child and Family Agency - tusla.ie (Link: https://www.tusla.ie/children-first/parents-and-guardians/how-do-i-report-a-
concern-about-a-child/) if you are worried that a child may have been, is being, or is at risk of being abused or neglected.

Learn about dependence and recovery
Understanding alcohol dependence and recovery can make you feel more in control.
Your GP can talk to you about alcohol dependence and advise you about recovering from alcohol dependence.
Alcohol dependence (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/living-well/alcohol/dependence/)
Talk to other people
Living with a dependent or problem drinker can make you feel isolated.
You may feel ashamed to talk about it or feel that you are the only person going through these problems.
You do not need to feel ashamed. Alcohol dependency affects many families from every social class, race and culture.
It can be a relief to talk to other people, particularly people going through the same thing.
There are support groups for families (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/living-well/alcohol/coping-difficult-situations/services-for-families/)

You can also turn to trusted friends, a therapist, or other resources in your community.

If you have children
How to help your children:
Arrange a weekly activity - for example, watching a movie, playing a game together or going to the park.
Agree with the person drinking that they will not get drunk in front of the children.
Arrange a sleepover with friends or family.
Learn active listening techniques (Link: https://www2.hse.ie/mental-health/helping-someone-else/being-a-good-listener/) -
